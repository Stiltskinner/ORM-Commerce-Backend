## Description
This is the back-end for a fictional commerce website. It uses sequelize models to build and maintain a database with tables for products, categories of products, and tags for products. It has routes for getting information, creating new products, categories, and tags, updating all the aforementioned, and deleting all of the aforementioned. It also validates the data to ensure it is the right kind.

## Installation
open the terminal and type npm i. Log into mysql and run the schema in the terminal or in mysql workbench. Type npm run seed in the terminal if you would like to seed your tables with data for demonstration purposes.

## Usage
After completing the installation process described above, type npm start in the terminal. You can then use insomnia to test out the routes.

## Contributors
This program uses some pre-provided code from the UT Austin Bootcamp. I also collaborated on syntaxd and ideas with a few of my peers in the coding bootcamp, but all code not provided by the bootcamp was written by me.

## Testing
Set up your database and tables, run seeds, and try out routes in insomnia!
